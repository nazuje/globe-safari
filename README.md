# 🧸 Playroom

A cozy shelf of small web games for young children, to play alone or with a grown-up. The portal at the site root shows every game as a big tile, with filters for who's playing, age, type of game and language. Each game lives at its own sub-path.

Live at <https://nazuje.github.io/playroom/>, with games at `/playroom/<slug>/`.

## Layout

```
games.json            the registry: every game the portal shows
portal/               the game picker, served at the site root
games/<slug>/         one folder per game
games/_template/      a working starter game, copied to make new ones
packages/stage3d/     @playroom/stage3d: the 3D scene the 3D games share
packages/kit/         @playroom/kit: speech, languages, sound effects, star burst, home button, store, kit.css
scripts/build-site.mjs  builds the portal and every ready game into dist/
scripts/voice/        generates Slovenian speech clips ahead of time
scripts/playtest.mjs  mashes built games in Chrome and reports what broke
docs/making-games.md  the rules every game follows
.claude/              shared agent setup: the game tester and reviewed three.js skills
```

It is one npm workspace with one root `package-lock.json`. TypeScript, Vite and Vitest live at the root. Each game keeps its own dependencies.

## Run it

You need Node.js 22.18 or newer, which can read TypeScript directly.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev                          # the portal, with every ready game at /<slug>/
npm run dev -w @playroom/<slug>      # one game on its own
npm test                             # every workspace's tests
npm run typecheck                    # every workspace, including the template
npm run build                        # the whole site into dist/
npm run preview                      # serve dist/ at http://localhost:5179
npm run playtest -- <slug>           # mash a built game in Chrome, on phone and tablet, in each language
```

`npm run dev` is enough to click through the whole site. A small Vite plugin in `portal/devGames.ts` runs each ready game inside the portal's dev server, so tile links work and edits to a game reload the page. A game has to be `"ready"` in `games.json` to appear there. While a game is still `"coming-soon"`, use `npm run dev -w @playroom/<slug>`.

## The registry

`games.json` is an array with one entry per game:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `slug` | Folder name in `games/` and the URL path |
| `title`, `emoji` | Shown on the tile |
| `tagline` | One short kid-friendly line |
| `skills` | Any of `fun`, `action`, `3d`, `world`, `memory`, `logic`, `colors`, `reading`, `numbers`, `moving` |
| `ages` | A range such as `"4-9"`. The portal's age filter shows a game when the chosen age falls inside it, ends included |
| `modes` | `"solo"`, `"together"`, or both: how the game can be played |
| `languages` | `"en"`, `"sl"`, or both: the languages the game is fully playable in. The portal shows a language chip once a game has it, and the language row itself once there are two languages. A tile shows a flag badge when a game has more than one language or isn't in English |
| `translations` | Optional names per language, such as `{ "sl": { "title": "...", "tagline": "..." } }`. The tile uses them when that language is on |
| `color` | Hex accent for the tile |
| `status` | `"ready"` or `"coming-soon"` |

`"coming-soon"` games show as dimmed tiles and are not built. `"ready"` games are linked and built, and the build fails loudly if a ready game has no `games/<slug>/` folder or no `build` script, or if a game listing `"sl"` is missing a clip for any line it declares. **When your game is finished, flip its own entry to `"ready"`.**

## Template: add a new game

1. Copy the template. Folders starting with `_` are ignored by the site build, so the copy needs a real name:

   ```sh
   cp -R games/_template games/<slug>
   ```

2. In `games/<slug>/package.json`, set `"name"` to `"@playroom/<slug>"`. Two workspaces can't share a name, so do this before anything else.
3. In `games/<slug>/index.html`, change the title, description, favicon emoji and heading.
4. Add an entry to `games.json` with `"status": "coming-soon"`, or update the one already there.
5. Run `npm install` at the root. This adds the game to `package-lock.json`, and CI's `npm ci` fails without it. If two people add games at once, take either side of a lockfile conflict and run `npm install` again.
6. Build the game in `games/<slug>/src/`, and start it with `npm run dev -w @playroom/<slug>`. If it has tests, add `"test": "vitest run"` to its scripts and `npm test` picks them up.
7. When it's done, set `"status": "ready"` and check `npm run build`.

Keep the game's `base: './'` and use relative paths only, because the site runs under `/playroom/`.

## The kit

Games import from `@playroom/kit`. It is plain TypeScript with no dependencies and no build step of its own; Vite bundles it into each game.

- `say(text, options?)`: speaks a line and returns a promise that resolves when it has finished. It always resolves, with timeouts for voices that never start or never end, and waits about as long as the line would take when there is no voice at all. Options: `rate` and `pitch` for device voices, `slow` for a slow recording, `queue: true` to wait behind the current line instead of cutting it off, and `signal` to stop it early.
- `speak(text)`, `canSpeak()`, `stopSpeaking()`: `speak` is `say` when you don't need to know when it ends. `canSpeak` tells you whether a 🔊 button would do anything. All are safe to call where speech isn't supported. English uses the device's voices.
- `getLanguage()`, `setLanguage(language)`, `onLanguageChange(listener)`, `LANGUAGES`: the language in use, shared by the portal and every game. It defaults to `'en'`.
- `languageButton(['en', 'sl'])`: a big round flag for the top bar that switches language.
- `useClips(manifest)`: plays recorded clips for Slovenian lines. Until a game calls it, that game speaks English whatever the shared language is.
- `slCount`, `slNumber`, `slCounted`: Slovenian counting grammar. See below.
- `missingClips(manifest, lines, slowLines?)`: lines with no clip, for a game's test.
- `playSound(name)`, `playNote(hz, options?)`, `SOUND_NAMES`: short sound effects (`pop`, `boing`, `ding`, `whoosh`, `bonk`, `dig`, `burp`, `toot`, `tada`) and single musical notes, made with Web Audio so no sound files ship. Quiet no-ops where audio isn't available. Browsers only allow sound after a tap, so a game's first sound should come from one.
- `burst(x, y, count?)`: a star burst at a viewport position. It needs no CSS and calms down for people who prefer reduced motion.
- `homeButton()`: a big round 🏠 link back to the portal, for the game's top bar.
- `store.get(key, fallback)`, `store.set(key, value)`: small JSON values in localStorage for this device, such as best scores. They never throw, so nothing important should rely on them.
- `import '@playroom/kit/kit.css'`: the Fredoka font, the palette as CSS custom properties, the page background, `.btn` with `.btn-sun`, `.btn-coral`, `.btn-leaf` and `.btn-grape`, `.topbar` with `.topbar-end`, and reduced-motion handling.

## 3D games

3D games use [three.js](https://threejs.org) through `@playroom/stage3d`, so a fix for slow or old tablets reaches all of them. Add `@playroom/stage3d` and `three` to the game's dependencies and `@types/three` to its dev dependencies.

`createStage(host, { fov?, near?, far? })` fills `host` with a scene and returns `{ scene, camera, renderer, canvas, onFrame, start, stop, dispose }`, or `null` on a device that can't draw 3D, so a game can say so kindly. It handles screen size and tall phones, sharpness that drops by itself on a slow device, a safe time step after the tab sleeps, pausing while hidden, and a lost graphics context.

## Add a language to a game

A game stays one game, with a switch inside it. Slovenian speech is recorded ahead of time and ships with the game, because a tablet may have no Slovenian voice and a 4-year-old who can't read depends on hearing it. English keeps using device voices.

1. Put the words in `src/lang/`, one file per language with the same shape:

   ```ts
   // src/lang/en.ts
   export const en = {
     hello: 'Hello!',
     wantApples: (n: number) => (n === 1 ? 'Give me one apple!' : `Give me ${n} apples!`),
   };

   export type Text = typeof en;
   ```

   ```ts
   // src/lang/sl.ts
   import { slCounted, type SlNoun } from '@playroom/kit';
   import type { Text } from './en.ts';

   // A noun's forms are data, in the grammatical case the line needs. "Daj mi ..." takes the accusative.
   const APPLE: SlNoun = { gender: 'n', one: 'jabolko', two: 'jabolki', few: 'jabolka', many: 'jabolk' };

   export const sl: Text = {
     hello: 'Živjo!',
     wantApples: (n) => `Daj mi ${slCounted(n, APPLE, 'acc')}!`,
   };

   /** Every line the game can say in Slovenian, including every counted combination. */
   export function spokenLines(): string[] {
     return [sl.hello, ...[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map(sl.wantApples)];
   }
   ```

   ```ts
   // src/lang/index.ts
   import { getLanguage } from '@playroom/kit';
   import { en, type Text } from './en.ts';
   import { sl } from './sl.ts';

   export const text = (): Text => (getLanguage() === 'sl' ? sl : en);
   ```

   The pipeline reads `sl.ts` with plain Node, so `sl.ts` and anything it imports must stay free of CSS, assets and JSON. `spokenLines()` must return every string the game can pass to `say()` or `speak()`, exactly as spoken. If a line is built from parts, build every combination.

2. Generate the clips. Setup is once per machine, and [scripts/voice/README.md](scripts/voice/README.md) explains the rest:

   ```sh
   npm run voice:setup
   npm run voice -- <slug>
   ```

   This writes `public/voice/sl/*.mp3` and `src/lang/sl.clips.json`. Commit both.

3. Use the words, register the clips and add the switch. Read `text()` each time you draw or speak, never once at the top of a file:

   ```ts
   import { homeButton, languageButton, onLanguageChange, speak, useClips } from '@playroom/kit';
   import { text } from './lang/index.ts';
   import clips from './lang/sl.clips.json';

   useClips(clips);
   bar.append(homeButton(), title, languageButton(['en', 'sl']));

   // Redraw from the state you already have. Changing language must not lose progress.
   onLanguageChange(() => draw());

   speak(text().wantApples(3));
   ```

4. Add a test, so missing audio can't ship:

   ```ts
   // src/lang/sl.test.ts
   import { missingClips } from '@playroom/kit';
   import { expect, it } from 'vitest';
   import clips from './sl.clips.json';
   import { spokenLines } from './sl.ts';

   it('has a clip for every Slovenian line', () => {
     expect(missingClips(clips, spokenLines())).toEqual([]);
   });
   ```

5. Add `"sl"` to the game's `languages` in `games.json`. `npm run build` now refuses to pass if a declared line has no clip.

6. Listen to it. Run `npm run voice:words -- <slug>` and scan the stress on every word. To correct one, run `npm run voice:fix -- <word> <ipa>`, which fixes it everywhere and regenerates only the lines that use it.

### What to know about clips

- `say()` plays the clip for **exactly** the text it's given, so `'Bravo!'` and `'Bravo'` are different lines. A line with no clip uses a device Slovenian voice if there is one and otherwise stays quiet. It is never read with an English voice. In development it logs the line once.
- `rate` and `pitch` do nothing to a clip, because a recording plays as it was made. For a word read out slowly, also export `slowLines(): string[]` from `sl.ts` and call `say(word, { rate: 0.45, slow: true })`. English keeps using the rate and Slovenian plays the slow recording, which the pipeline generates for those lines. Add them to the test as `missingClips(clips, spokenLines(), slowLines())`.

### Writing Slovenian lines

- **Never assume the child's gender.** Players are boys and girls, so avoid gendered past-tense forms addressed to the child. Write `Bravo!` or `Odlično!`, not `Našel si`. Present tense and the imperative are safe: `Poišči jabolko!`, `Poskusi še enkrat.`
- **Counting has four forms**, and which one depends on the number's last two digits: `eno jabolko, dve jabolki, tri jabolka, štiri jabolka, pet jabolk`. `slCount(n, { one, two, few, many })` picks the form, so `21` correctly takes `many`.
- **Numbers agree with the noun's gender:** `en/ena/eno`, `dva/dve/dve`, `trije/tri/tri`. So each noun is data with its gender and forms (`SlNoun`), and `slCounted(n, noun, 'acc')` builds `dve jabolki`.
- **Mind the case.** Forms must match the sentence. `Daj mi ...` and `Hočem ...` take the accusative, so a feminine noun gives `eno banano`, and a masculine one gives `tri piškote`, not `trije piškoti`. Pass `'acc'` to `slCounted`. A masculine animate noun in the accusative takes `enega`, which the helper doesn't cover, so write that line by hand.
- **Counting out loud** with no noun uses the feminine forms: `ena, dve, tri, štiri, pet`. That's `slNumber(n, 'f')`.

## Deploy

Pushing to `main` runs `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which tests, builds and publishes `dist/` to GitHub Pages (turn on **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions** once in the repository).
