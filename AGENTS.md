# Playroom

Web games for a family with a 6-year-old and a 4-year-old who can't read yet, in English and Slovenian. Live at <https://nazuje.github.io/playroom/> from a public repo. `README.md` explains setup, the registry and how to add a game or a language.

Read `docs/making-games.md` before building or changing a game.

## Done means

1. `npm test`, `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` all exit 0. Read the exit codes, because `npm test` runs Node tests after vitest and a grep for vitest output misses them.
2. `npm run playtest -- <slug>` passes, after a build, and you've looked at the screenshots in `.playtest/`.
3. For a new game or a big change, a separate agent that didn't build it gives a **ship** verdict, following `.claude/agents/game-tester.md`.

Report what no script can check: real sound, real tablets and native Slovenian. No one has yet confirmed any of these on a real device.

## Guardrails

- These are children's games on a public site. Games keep everything on the device and have no accounts, analytics, ads, purchases, outbound links or calls to outside services. The existing exceptions are the Fredoka font from Google Fonts, Globe Safari's Wikipedia lookups and the credit links on the portal. `npm run playtest` fails on any other outside request.
- Every game is original. Names, characters and art never come from a commercial game.
- Pushing to `main` publishes straight to the live site. The repo is public, so keep personal details out of it.
- Lint and type errors are fixed in the code, never silenced.

## Gotchas

- A new workspace needs `npm install` at the root, or `npm ci` fails in CI.
- Slovenian clips in `public/voice/sl/` and `sl.clips.json` are committed, and the build fails on a missing clip. After changing any spoken Slovenian line, run `npm run voice -- <slug>`.
- The voice tool needs `npm run voice:setup` once per machine and Homebrew's `espeak-ng` on macOS, because Piper's bundled data path is broken there.
- `.claude/skills/` holds reviewed copies of third-party skills. Read any update in full before replacing them.
